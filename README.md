# Aerial Object Project

This repository contains datasets, notebooks, models, and application code for aerial bird vs drone classification and object detection experiments.

## Structure
- `classification_dataset/`: Image classification dataset split into train/valid/test folders with `bird` and `drone` classes.
- `object_detection_dataset/`: YOLO-style detection dataset with image and label splits for train/val/test.
- `notebooks/`: Ordered Jupyter notebooks for EDA, CNNs, transfer learning, and YOLOv8 detection workflows.
- `models/`: Serialized best-performing classification and detection models.
- `app.py`: Placeholder for the application entry point.
- `requirements.txt`: Placeholder for Python dependencies.

Populate each folder with the appropriate data, models, and code as you progress through the project.
